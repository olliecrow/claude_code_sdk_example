# Claude Code SDK Tutorial

A comprehensive tutorial for learning the Claude Code SDK with hands-on Jupyter notebook examples.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup the environment:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Lab:**
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open the tutorial notebook:**
   `claude_code_sdk.ipynb`

## What's Included

### 📓 Tutorial Notebook
- **11 comprehensive examples** covering all SDK features
- **Self-contained cells** that can be run independently  
- **Production-ready patterns** with proper error handling
- **Real-world use cases** like code generation and review

### 🛠️ Environment Setup
- **UV-based dependency management** for fast, reliable installs
- **Minimal dependencies** focused on the tutorial needs
- **Jupyter Lab/Notebook** for interactive development
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Tutorial Topics

1. **Basic Setup & Verification** - Get started with the SDK
2. **Simple Queries** - Make your first Claude Code requests
3. **Custom System Prompts** - Tailor Claude's behavior
4. **Multi-turn Conversations** - Build interactive dialogues
5. **Tools Integration** - Use file operations and bash commands
6. **JSON Output** - Get structured responses
7. **Error Handling** - Robust production patterns
8. **Code Generation** - Automated code creation
9. **Message Exploration** - Understanding SDK responses
10. **Advanced Configuration** - Fine-tuning SDK behavior
11. **Diagnostics** - Environment validation and debugging

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- UV package manager (auto-installed by setup script)
- Claude Code CLI (auto-installed by setup script)

## Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Install UV if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start Jupyter
uv run jupyter lab
```

## How It Works

The Claude Code SDK works seamlessly with your existing Claude Code subscription - no additional API key setup required! The SDK automatically uses your Claude Code authentication.
